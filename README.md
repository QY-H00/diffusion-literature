1. (2024)[Cross-Attention Makes Inference Cumbersome in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02747)
   - Cross-attention outputs converge to a fixed point in the first few steps: Denoising can be devided into 1) semantics-planning stage and 2) fidelity improving stage
   - Cross-Attention is redundant in the fidelity improving stage
